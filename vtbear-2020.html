          <p>Take a moment. Put yourself in the shoes of a CEO to a brand that has a reputation for top quality products and service for more than 20 years. It is late 2019 and you are happily running your business with a positive forecast for the coming quarter. From your perspective, everything is going to plan, but your in-house UI designer has just surprised you with some critical information. </p>
          <p>Based on extensive A/B testing, user video tracking, and competitive analysis, it has been discovered that, while the platform your website is hosted on works for your business, it is only half working for your customers. This included limited mobile first capabilities, difficult development cycles that hindered ability to run promotions, buried product visibility, as well as a handful of other key selling aspects. If you keep your shopping experience as is, you run the risk of loosing more and more sales as well as your valued brand recognition. On top of that, the system is at an end-of-life cycle and will require an update soon. Taking this all into consideration, you decide to find a new web service and migrate the site, now your team needs to make it happen. If all goes smoothly your shopping experience will become more normalized.

          <h4 class="h6 fw-semibold text-uppercase mt-5 pb-2 border-bottom">Initial Research:</h4>
          <p>With the realization that Magento 1.0 was at the end of a cycle and it was time to update the system, in 2019, Todd and his team began collecting data inorder to decide if the brand should stay with the current platform or move to a new one. To kick off the project, they reviewed the following.</p>
          <p class="fw-bold">Competitive Analysis</p>
          <ul>
            <li>What were other brands focusing on at the time? </li>
            <li>What did other websites offer that Pajamagram.com could not? </li>
            <li>How did our competitors keep users coming back? </li>
          </ul>

          <p class="fw-bold">Internal Testing</p>
          <ul>
            <li>How long were shoppers on each page, in cart, at checkout? </li>
            <li>What percentage of users were using mobile phones? </li>
            <li>Was accessibility holding us back? </li>
            <li>How could we rank higher in search engines? </li>
            <li>Was there a way to make the site more flexible, easier to manage, and perform better both internally and customer facing? </li>
              
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Surprising Results</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A/B testing and user insights from the 2017 design highlighted areas of improvement that Magento 1.0 couldn’t support.
                <ul>
                  <li>Mobile phone users were on the rise and Magento 1.0 did not have a mobile first experience. </li>
                  <li>Magento 1.0 templates were very fixed with limited layout opportunities on the homepage, which was the site’s most trafficked page. This limited product visibility and discovery. </li>
                  <li>Throughout the user journey, marketing and engagement opportunities on Magento 1.0 were incredibly limited. For example, there were no gallery inserts.</li>
                  <li>The Magento 1.0 framework was very fixed with limited autonomy. This did not leave room for the ability to run promotions easily, which was and still is a growing trend, as well as left little control over the user experience. </li>
                  <li>Roadblocks in the user journey from homepage to checkout created frustration for users. They were not able to easily find or select products and checkout within minutes, which lead to many abandoned carts.</li>
                  <li>Hotjar video testing and A/B testing indicated that the user experience did not meet user expectations. Traffic of the site was rising, but conversion rates were dropping.</li>
                  <li>Roadblocks in the user journey from homepage to checkout created frustration for users. The gift experience in cart was taking forever and did not serve shoppers the way it needed to. </li>
                  <li>A/B testing indicated that the user experience did not meet user expectations. Traffic on the site was rising, but conversion rates were dropping. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

          </ul>

          <h4 class="h6 fw-semibold text-uppercase mt-5 pb-2 border-bottom">Proposing The Project:</h4>
          <p>By 2020, a choice to move platforms was made. Todd and his team would migrate from Magento 1.0 to Commerce Cloud. This decision became a vital first step towards normalizing the Pajamagram.com shopping experience.</p>
          <p class="fw-bold">What Commerce Cloud Could Offer</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A flexible platform that provided more marketing opportunities and methods. </li>
            <li>It would be able to increase product visibility and accessibility on the homepage.</li>
            <li>It would offer tech updates that would streamline the shopping experience and help users make purchases faster.</li>
            <li>For the first time user needs could take priority in a way that balanced business goals and parameters.</li>
            <li>This platform would allow a redesign of the mobile experience to increase engagement, increase conversion, and minimize friction in the user journey.</li>
            <li>Allowed for the optimization of desktop experience for efficiency, given desktop users converted at a higher rate.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Family Set Builder</strong> - a unique shopping experience that allowed users to easily and intuitively find matching product sets. This was designed in efforts to reduce the amount of time a user spent looking for products only to discover they were not available as well as to reduce the amount of abandoned carts. Featured functions:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Person, style, and size filters</li>
            <li>Guaranteed product visibility</li>
            <li>Focused products displayed</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p><strong>Gift Experience</strong> - previously, on the old platform, every shopper was required to go through an upsell sequence at checkout that required many steps to finally reach their cart. With the new platform, the enhancements included: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>A less intrusive format that was optional for users and reduced shopping time.</li>
            <li>Full accessibility throughout the whole shopping process.</li>
            <li>Purview of upsells like personalization to their products.</li>
            <li>Enhanced discoverability of products.</li>
            <li>Simplicity and efficiency made the system easy to learn and manage.</li>

          <p>With Pajamagram.com hosted on Commerce Cloud, Todd and his team saw drastic improvements within various touchpoints throughout the user experience. The overall redesign supported the growing number of mobile shoppers as well as the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Product visibility. The user no longer had to dig to find what they were looking for. Navigation supported shopping needs.</li>  
            <li>Promotion messaging. The team was able to support simultaneous sales and adapt them without issue. </li>
            <li>All templates were redesigned for A/B testing. In order to stay current, the team was now able to run tests to see how users reacted to touchpoints and then effortlessly update based on the results. </li>
